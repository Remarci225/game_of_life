# Game of Life by petya0927
Simple Game of Life simulation in Pyhton 3., based on the work of John Horton Conway. It is a cellular automaton, means each cell on the screen is generated by the state of other cells. We can create a lot of generated structures. More on [Conway's Game of Life - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## User manual

Dependencies:
- Python ^3. If you don't have it installed, you can download and install it from https://www.python.org/
- Pygame ^2. Follow the instructions Pygame's GitHub page: https://github.com/pygame/pygame

Once you installed everything and started the game_of_life.pyw script, you can place squares in the grid where every black cell is alive, every white cell is dead. By hitting the ```space``` key, you can start the simulation, where every frame is generated based on the rules below. You can slow or accelerate the simulation by hitting the ```s``` (slow) or ```a``` (accelerate) keys. You can restart the game and the simulation by hitting the ```r``` key any time. 

### Rules:
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

### Basic keybindings:

- ```space``` : switch mode between Editing and Playing. Default is Editing.
- ```r``` : delete every alive cell, and restart the game.
- ```s``` : slow the simulation by 30ms with each keystroke.
- ```a``` : acceleratee the simulation by 30ms with each keystroke.
